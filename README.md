Thicket - an unofficial Level Loader for Ultrakill (now possibly outdated)

written for fun!

feature set: it loads levels (amazing i know)

how it works:
  unlike Tundra, the official level editor for Ultrakill, Thicket loads levels from a massive prefab, which requires a multitude of various bits to function properly
  the most basic things you need for a level boil down to:
    -- a level start
    -- a level end
    -- level geometry
    -- a navigation mesh (baking it normally won't work you need to use something else to bake it into the prefab)


Cool Disclaimer:
- thicket worked at the time of writing, it may not be working due to changes to the Ultrakill game itself and might need repairs by anyone who may want to use it.
